[{"categories":["Conference paper"],"contents":"Abstract Reliable shoulder function and pain assessment tools are important for the medical management in patients with adhesive capsulitis (AC). Several works have developed objective evaluation tools for shoulder function, but few of them focused on the pain. Currently, the pain assessment for AC still relies on the self-report by the patients. This pilot study proposed objective pain assessment tools for AC using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and machine learning (ML) approaches. The experiment recruited 23 AC patients who performed 5 shoulder tasks and reported pain scores based on the shoulder pain and disability index. Two IMUs were placed on the wrist and arm while performing shoulder tasks. We analyzed the correlations between pain scores and two IMU feature categories (e.g., smoothness, power, and speed). Moreover, we built pain prediction models with all extracted IMU features and different ML approaches. The results showed that the smoothness-related features have higher Spearman correlations with patient-reported pain scores than the category of power and speed features. ML- based pain prediction model using Gaussian process regression had strong and significant Spearman correlations (0.795,p\u0026lt;0.01), 5.680 mean absolute error, and 6.663 root mean square error.

Reliable shoulder assessment is essential for AC evaluation and diagnosis. Most traditional assessment approaches focus on shoulder function; however, few studies have developed an objective method to evaluate shoulder pain in patients with AC. Our aim is to propose an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based evaluation approach for ACs. Twenty-three frozen shoulder (FS) patients and 20 healthy subjects participated in this study. The subjects performed five shoulder tasks based on the shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) while using wrist-worn and arm-worn IMUs. These tasks consisted of washing hair (WH), washing the upper back (WUB), washing the lower back (WLB), placing an object on a high shelf (POH), and removing an object from the back pocket (ROP). In this study, we calculated seven IMU feature types extracted from the IMU signals, including smoothness, power, and speed, and evaluated the effectiveness of these features in quantifying the pain scores of SPADI. The results demonstrate that moderate positive (negative) correlations mostly occur for ROP, particularly with the smoothness feature type. These results demonstrate the potential feasibility of an IMU-based pain assessment approach for AC.
